=== Abstract

We develop a beam-hardening correction method for polychromatic
X-ray CT reconstruction based on _mass attenuation
coefficient discretization_. We assume that the inspected object
consists of an unknown single material and that the incident
X-ray spectrum is unknown. In this case, the standard
photon-energy discretization of the Beer's law measurement equation
leads to an excessive number of unknown parameters and scaling
ambiguity. To obtain a parsimonious measurement model
parametrization, we first rewrite the measurement equation in terms
of integral expressions of the mass attenuation rather than photon
energy. The resulting integrals can be discretized easily thanks to
the fact that the range of mass attenuations is bounded and, in
practice, fairly narrow. We then develop a constrained least-squares
optimization approach for reconstructing the underlying object from
log-scale measurements, where we impose the nonnegativity constraint
to both the signal and the X-ray spectrum density
estimates. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via
a numerical example where we compare it with the standard FBP, which 
ignores the polychromatic nature of the measurements.

=== Background

According to the Lambert-Beer's law, the fraction $\dif \cI / \cI$ of plane 
wave intensity lost in traversing an infinitesimal thickness $\dif\ell$ at 
Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ is proportional to $\dif\ell$, so that

++++
\[
    \frac\{\dif \cI\}\{\cI\} = - \mu(\varepsilon) \alpha(x,y) \dif\ell.
    \label\{eq:beerLaw1\}
\]
++++

where

* $\mu(\varepsilon)$ is the _mass attenuation coefficient_ of the 
    material (in cm^2^/g), which depends only on the photon energy 
    $\varepsilon$,
* $\alpha(x,y)$ is the density map of the inspected object (in g/cm^3^).

Therefore, a monochromatic X-ray signal at photon energy $\varepsilon$ 
attenuates _exponentially_ as it penetrates an object composed of a single 
material:

++++
\[
    \cI^\{\text\{out\}\} = \cI^\{\text\{in\}\}  \exp\Bigl[ - 
    \mu(\varepsilon) \int_\ell \alpha(x,y) \dif\ell\Bigr].
    \label\{eq:monotoneModel\}
\]
++++
where +++$\cI^{\text{out}}$+++ and $$$\cI^{\text{in}}$$$ are the emergent 
and incident X-ray signal energies, respectively.

However, X-rays generated by vacuum tubes are not monochromatic.  To 
describe the polychromatic X-ray source, assume that its incident 
intensity $\cI^{\text{in}}$ spreads along photon energy $\varepsilon$ 
following the density $\iota(\varepsilon)$, i.e.,
++++
\[
+++
    \label{eq:constanttotalenergy}
    \int \iota(\varepsilon) \dif\varepsilon = \cI^{\text{in}}.
    +++
\]
++++

Then, the noiseless measurement collected by an energy integral
detector upon traversing a straight line $\ell=\ell(x,y)$ is
++++
\[
+++
\cI^{\text{out}}=\int \iota(\varepsilon) \,
\exp\Big[- \mu(\varepsilon) \, \int_\ell \alpha(x,y) \, \dif\ell\Big] \, 
\dif\varepsilon.
\label{eq:polyModel0}

=== Main Idea

+++<span class="imageblock" style="float:left; margin-right:35px;">+++

+++</span>+++

.Assumption:
** Both incident spectrum $\iota(\varepsilon)$ and mass attenuation
  function $\mu(\varepsilon)$ of the object are _unknown_.

.Objective:
* Estimate the density map $\alpha(x,y)$.

Based on the fact that mass attenuation $\mu(\varepsilon)$ and incident 
spectrum density $\iota(\varepsilon)$ are both functions of $\varepsilon$, 
our *idea* is to:

* write the model as integrals of $\mu$ rather than $\varepsilon$;
* estimate $\iota(\varepsilon(\mu)) |\varepsilon'(\mu)|$ rather than $\iota(\varepsilon)$ and $\mu(\varepsilon)$.

For invertible $\mu(\varepsilon)$, define its inverse as $\varepsilon(\mu)$ 
and

++++
\[
    \mathcal\{I\}^\{\mathrm\{in\}\}
    = \int \iota(\varepsilon(\mu)) |\varepsilon'(\mu)| d\mu, \qquad
    \mathcal\{I\}^\{\mathrm\{out\}\}
    = \int \iota(\varepsilon(\mu)) |\varepsilon'(\mu)|
    \exp\Bigl[ -\mu \int_\ell \alpha(x,y)  d\ell\Bigr] d\mu
\]
